#Instanews NYT Reader Project 

###Project Background
Instanews NYT Reader project is an introduction to pulling information out of an external API. Using ajax I pulled news articles from the New York Times API and compiled them into a website. 

###Technologies Used
Using Gulp tasks I was able to create minified files for javascript and css as well as detecting any syntax errors in my code as I worked through the project. This website incorporates the use of Responsive Web Design (RWD) as the site can be viewed from either mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. JavaScript and Jquery were used to append html and css via the .js file. 

###Learning Outcomes
Working on this project improved my skills and confidence in writing and understanding JavaScript code. It also allowed me to focus more on proper syntax as even one missed "," or "'" could affect the results of the code.
